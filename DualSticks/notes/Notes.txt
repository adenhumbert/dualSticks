objCtlInit - This just sits in the initialization room and would move to the next room once it
	detects a click or finger touch

objMultiTouchReceiver - This thing is a persistent object.  It is responsible for detecting and tracking fingers
	and nothing else.  It sets the global variables for finger tracking.
	
objJoystick - This is a joystick.  It looks in the global variables and calculates joystick position when
	a finger is in range.  It also can "retain" a finger if the finger goes out of the joystick range
	but is not actually lifted up.  This is optional.
	
objShip - The ship creates the two joysticks and puts them in the corners.  It keeps the instance IDs
	so it can later access the joysticks to do movement and shooting.
